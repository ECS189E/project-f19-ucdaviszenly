# ECS189E Final Project -- Footprint

## Intro
Footprint is a mobile app allowing user to keep their diaries based on their map location.
Users can easily start their diaries by pressing the Camera button and hitting the Disk button to upload their dailys.
Users can easily fetch their diary data from our database. In another word, data can be tranformed between different devices.
Users can also have a review of their diaries by preesing the Calender button.

## Magical experience
A machine learning model is imported once the user uploads the picture. It will auto indicate the objects in the picture which simplify the process of making a diary.
