## Currently known issues and concerns:
1 We now use facebook ios sdk to let user login with their facebook account, but we don't
know how to fetch the user's data from facebook and save it to our database.

2 Facebook ios sdk seems too complex for us to use so we decide to use firebase as our 
database.

3 We don't know how to get friend's location from other device.
