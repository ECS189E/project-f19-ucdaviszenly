# Sprint Planning 3
Time: November 17th, 2019

Trello Link: https://trello.com/b/uB9ti7YQ/ucdavis-zenly

## Sprint Goal:
Add more functionality to our mapDiary app. Improve our app's UI interface to
make it look nice.

## Current Progress:
User can add marker on the map and upload the event in marker popup view.

We can save the content and image which upload by users in marker into database
and also fetch these data when user click on this marker again.

## Product backlog:
1 load marker: save each marker on the map so that when user open this app again,
all previous markers can be shown on the map.

2 delete marker: when user click on the marker which they already have, they can
either edit it or delete.

3 uploading progress bar: when user upload the picture, there is a progress bar
to show the uploading progress of the picture.

4 limit the quality of picture: limit the quality of the picture which uploads
by user. If the picture is too big, the uploading time will be slow and that's
not a good user experience.

5 activity indicator: We need an activity indicator for uploading the picture.
When the uploading doesn't finish, user can't interact with any element in the
view.

6 finish the login process: Allow user to enter their user name and upload profile
photo during login process.

7 user profile: a user profile which contains the basic information about the
user and a list of all diary which upload by the user.

8 design ui: since the user for this app probably most of are girls, we need to
design our ui to make it look nice and cute in order to attract more users.

9 select date for dairy: allow user to select the date on the diary they upload
and store it in database.


## Deliver Task:
1 Jiaxin Zhao: load marker, design ui, select date for dairy

2 Lanqing Cheng: delete marker, finish the login process

3 Niu Shang : user profile, finish the login process

4 Zirong Yu: activity indicator, limit the quality of picture, uploading progress
bar


## Currently Known Issues and Concerns:
1 Since our previous blueprint of our app is too ambitious, we don't know whether
this modified version of blueprint meets expectation.

2 We don't know whether we need add more functionality to our app.

3 We don't know whether our app is interesting to other people.



## Team Productivity:
Lanqing Cheng: Good at searching for information online.

Jiaxin Zhao: Organize the teamâ€™s planning

Niu Shang: Review code and bug finding

Zirong Yu: Good at coding.


## Set Time Limit:
limit the quality of picture, uploading progress bar: 1 day

design ui: 2 days

user profile:1 day

finish the login process: 1 day

delete marker, load marker, select date for dairy, activity indicator: 2 days
