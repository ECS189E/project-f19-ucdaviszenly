## Sprint Goal:
Improve User Interface to make it nicer and cleaner, improve the event list for 
markers, fix long marker loading time issue and add the dispaly view and share 
events with other users.


## Current Progress:

User can add marker on map by simply taking a picture with camera. This 
function aims to simplify user experience.

Add the event list to display all user's stored events on map. Displayed information 
includes time, content, marker image.

## Product backlog:

Improve the event list: add the function that display corresponding 
marker information (display view triggered here) when user clicks on the one of the events.

Add a dispaly view for marker: In order to make app more user friendly, we need to 
add a marker dispaly popup view on map. When user triggers this view , the map will 
be located to marker location and the view will display the date the marker is created 
and the word content stored in the marker .

Share events list with other users: Users can share his/her events list by letting other
users has access to his/her own event list.
